# AI Portfolio and Research

Over the past two years, I've developed more than a hundred LLM applicationsâ€”combining experimental projects for fun with practical solutions to real-world challenges. Here's a showcase of my key projects and research:

## Document Intelligence System

I developed a sophisticated machine learning-based bookkeeping system to tackle the challenges of processing financial documents in hospitality and retail businesses. The system includes:

- Advanced ETL pipeline using GenAI for document processing
- Multi-model approach combining GPT-4, Gemini-Flash-2.0, and Whisper API
- Real-time frontend with FastAPI, React, and Tailwind CSS
- Intelligent search system with RAG-driven retrieval
- Cost-effective solution processing thousands of documents

### Technical Implementation

The system features:

- Payment reference recognition using fine-tuned LLMs
- Parallel document retrieval and classification
- Multimodal LLM extraction with Pydantic validation
- Cost classification based on Dutch accounting standards
- Real-time websocket updates and interactive UI
- Vector-based semantic search capabilities

## Research Contributions

### Reinforcement Learning for RAG Systems

My research paper introduces a novel approach to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through reinforcement learning. Key innovations include:

- Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for self-optimizing retrieval
- Closed-domain approach with discrete chunk IDs
- Synthetic dataset training methodology
- Industrial applications for service engineering

### Foundation Models Research

I've conducted research on foundation models and scientific innovation, examining:

- Capability assessment on novel problems
- Architectural factors affecting innovation
- Training methodologies for scientific reasoning
- Evaluation frameworks for creative output
- Case studies of successes and failures

## GenAI Applications

### Waitler - AI Hospitality Assistant

Developed an AI-powered hospitality assistant featuring:

- Natural conversational interface
- Smart preference learning system
- Integration with venue POS systems
- LLM and RAG pipeline implementation
- Knowledge graph-based flavor prediction

### Realtime Slide Generator

Created an innovative presentation tool that:

- Generates slides dynamically from speech
- Incorporates emotion analysis
- Creates real-time diagrams using Mermaid JS
- Adapts to speaker flow and audience engagement

## Community Contributions

- Keynote speaker at the European Chatbot and Conversational AI Summit
- Interview with Jason Liu, creator of the Instructor Library
- Host of AI Builders Club monthly meetup
- Masterclass instructor for Dell/NVIDIA on Scaling AI
- Regular technical blog contributor

## Open Source Projects

- Computer Vision hand tracking system
- Simplified document processing pipeline
- Various AI tools and utilities

All projects demonstrate a commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI technology while creating practical, real-world solutions.
