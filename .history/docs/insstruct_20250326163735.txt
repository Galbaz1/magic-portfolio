I’m using the Magic MCP (Model Context Protocol) in my Cursor agent workflow to manage components in my project. First, use the Magic MCP protocol to install the container-scroll-animation component from 21st.dev, located at the URL https://21st.dev/r/aceternity/container-scroll-animation. This is a UI component, and the Magic MCP should install it into the @/components/ui directory of my project, ensuring all necessary configurations and dependencies are handled automatically. After installation, implement this component in my Portfolio's home page. Since I’m using Next.js 13+ with the app directory, the HomePage.tsx file should remain a server component. To handle animations with Framer Motion, create a separate client component named AnimatedContent.tsx in the /components directory with the "use client" directive at the top. The AnimatedContent.tsx component should contain all the Framer Motion animation logic, while HomePage.tsx should import and use this client component. The implementation should closely follow the design and animation behavior supported by the container-scroll-animation component, including any scroll-based transitions and layout logic. The animation should include a main heading styled with Tailwind CSS classes text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold text-white text-center, and a subheading below it styled with text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-300 text-center. Below the subheading, add a button with the text 'About me' styled with Tailwind CSS classes bg-white text-black px-6 py-2 rounded-full text-base font-medium shadow-md hover:shadow-xl transition, and include a profile image inside the button using a circular avatar (e.g., w-6 h-6 rounded-full). The layout should remain centered with Tailwind utility classes and follow a clean, responsive layout using flex and padding utilities. In HomePage.tsx, simply import and render the AnimatedContent component without any additional logic, ensuring it remains a server component. Ensure all required dependencies, such as framer-motion, are installed and managed through the Magic MCP protocol if they are not already present in my project. Do not change any other functionalities in my app, and make sure the implementation works with my existing Tailwind CSS setup (I have tailwind.config.js in my project).
