# 21st.dev Magic AI Agent


Magic Component Platform (MCP) is a powerful AI-driven tool that helps developers create beautiful, modern UI components instantly through natural language descriptions. It integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs and provides a streamlined workflow for UI development.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered UI Generation**: Create UI components by describing them in natural language


## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Tell Agent What You Need**
   - Describe the component you're looking for in 
   - Example: `/ui create a modern navigation bar with responsive design`
2. **Let Magic Create It**
   - Your IDE prompts you to use Magic
   - Magic instantly builds a polished UI component
   - Components are inspired by 21st.dev's library
3. **Seamless Integration**
   - Components are automatically added to your project
   - Start using your new UI components right away
   - All components are fully customizable

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- One of the supported IDEs:
  - Cursor
  - Windsurf
  - VSCode (with Cline extension)

### Installation

1. **Generate API Key**
   - Visit [21st.dev Magic Console](https://21st.dev/magic/console)
   - Generate a new API key
2. **Choose Installation Method**

#### Method 1: CLI Installation (Recommended)

One command to install and configure MCP for your IDE:

```bash
npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install <client> --api-key <key>
```

Supported clients: cursor, windsurf, cline, claude

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, add this to your IDE's MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@21st-dev/magic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@21st-dev/magic@latest", "API_KEY=\"your-api-key\""]
    }
  }
}
```

Config file locations:
- Cursor: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- Windsurf: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
- Cline: `~/.cline/mcp_config.json`
- Claude: `~/.claude/mcp_config.json`

## ❓ FAQ

### How does Magic AI Agent handle my codebase?
Magic AI Agent only writes or modifies files related to the components it generates. It follows your project's code style and structure, and integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase without affecting other parts of your application.

### Can I customize the generated components?
Yes! All generated components are fully editable and come with well-structured code. You can modify the styling, functionality, and behavior just like any other React component in your codebase.

### What happens if I run out of generations?
If you exceed your monthly generation limit, you'll be prompted to upgrade your plan. You can upgrade at any time to continue generating components. Your existing components will remain fully functional.

### How soon do new components get added to 21st.dev's library?
Authors can publish components to 21st.dev at any time, and Magic Agent will have immediate access to them. This means you'll always have access to the latest components and design patterns from the community.

### Is there a limit to component complexity?
Magic AI Agent can handle components of varying complexity, from simple buttons to complex interactive forms. However, for best results, we recommend breaking down very complex UIs into smaller, manageable components.
