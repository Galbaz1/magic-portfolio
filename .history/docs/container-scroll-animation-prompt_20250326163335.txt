## 21st dev mcp prompt

"I'm using the Magic MCP (Model Context Protocol) in my Cursor agent workflow to manage components in my project. First, use the Magic MCP protocol to install the `container-scroll-animation` component from 21st.dev, located at the URL https://21st.dev/r/aceternity/container-scroll-animation. This is a UI component, and the Magic MCP should install it into the @/components/ui directory of my project, ensuring all necessary configurations and dependencies are handled automatically. 

After installation, implement this component in my Portfolio site's home page, which is located at src/app/page.tsx. Since I'm using Next.js 13+ with the app directory, the page.tsx file should remain a server component. To handle animations with Framer Motion, create a separate client component named ScrollAnimationSection.tsx in the /components/sections directory with the "use client" directive at the top.

The ScrollAnimationSection.tsx component should contain all the Framer Motion animation logic, while page.tsx should import and use this client component. The implementation should closely follow the design and animation behavior supported by the container-scroll-animation component, including smooth scroll-based transitions that reveal content as the user scrolls down the page.

The animation should include:
1. A main heading styled with Tailwind CSS classes text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold text-white text-center with the text 'My Projects'
2. A subheading below it styled with text-lg md:text-xl text-neutral-300 text-center with the text 'Scroll to explore my work'
3. Below the subheading, add a button with the text 'View All Projects' styled with Tailwind CSS classes bg-white text-black px-6 py-2 rounded-full text-base font-medium shadow-md hover:shadow-xl transition
4. The animation should transition between 3-4 featured projects from my portfolio as the user scrolls

This section should be added below the existing hero section, maintaining the responsive design of the rest of the site. In page.tsx, import and render the ScrollAnimationSection component, ensuring it remains a server component.

Ensure all required dependencies, such as framer-motion, are installed and managed through the Magic MCP protocol if they are not already present in my project. Make sure the implementation works with my existing Tailwind CSS setup (I have tailwind.config.js in my project) and matches the overall design aesthetic of my portfolio site with appropriate colors and styling.

Please provide clear implementation steps and any necessary code changes to successfully integrate this animation component into my portfolio site."
