  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.s.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  
  Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

  The project that you are working on is fully explained here, never change code that is not strictly needed. Follow the user's requests.
